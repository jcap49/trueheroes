    <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <li><i>Why should I pledge?</i></li>
        <p>
          Many folks risk their lives on a daily basis to keep us safe.
          By pledging, you are committing to express your gratitude to these
          people and their selfless efforts. <u></u>
        </p>
      <li><i>Are my pledges publicly viewable?</i></li>
        <p>
          Yes. Public pledges introduce an element of accountability that will
          hopefully encourage more folks to follow through, while also giving others
          an example by which to create their own.
        </p>
      <li><i>How can I share my pledges?</i></li>
        <p>
          You can use the social media buttons to tweet your pledges on Twitter or
          like and share them on Facebook. Feel free to also share the unique url of your
          pledges via email or other methods.
        </p>
      <li><i>How do I mark my pledges as complete?</i></li>
        <p>
          You'll get an email on the date you indicated when you first submitted the pledge
          asking whether or not it's been completed. If it is, hit the button marking it as
          complete and share that you completed it. If not, what are you waiting for?
        </p>
    </ul>
